For v0.1 :
    I want to create a class for my shares bought.
    I will start off with a simple Class that only has string attributes to get working
    and focus on the design and create Diagrams as I go.
    Define class relationships, have a list with share bought information
    then adjust class attributes to be more appropriate than strings.
